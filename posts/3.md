Hi, everyone. It's Drew here! 

Right now, I have just me and 1 other person in a team of organizers. Money in a non-profit organization is tight, and every penny goes back into the project

So, if you would like to help, financially or with organizing, you can sponsor us, on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tbilisihc) ([click](https://patreon.com/tbilisihc)) or, by messaging [tbilisihc@gmail](mailto:tbilisihc@gmail)

Greatly appreciated!

Drew, Founder of Tbilisi Hack Club
